Special UI notifications outside the website are platform independent.
We provide standalone versions for Microsoft Windows starting from XP and MacOS from 10.6 to the current versions on our website.

## Using the development version

If you are using a platform that is targeted by our standalone builds you can also use that version together with this git repository.
On Windows create a file named `download_am_dev.txt` in your home directory (enter `%HOMEPATH%` in your filebrowser to find) and write the full path where you cloned this repository into.
On other systems do the same with a file called `.download.am.dev` also in your home directory.
